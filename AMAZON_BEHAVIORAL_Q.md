# Amazon Principles
- Customer Obsession: Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust
- Ownership: They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company. Never say thats not my job.
- Invent and Simplify: Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here"
- Are Right, A Lot: seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs
- Learn and Be Curious: Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
- Hire and Develop the Best: Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization
- Insist on the Highest Standards: Leaders have relentlessly high standards 
- Think Big: Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results
- Bias for Action: Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study.
- Frugality: Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention
- Earn Trust: Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing
- Dive Deep: Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.
- Have Backbone: Disagree and Commit: Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting
- Deliver Results: Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
- Strive to be Earth's Best Employer: Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun.
- Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility: Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.



# Questions
- Tell me about a time when you went over and beyond for a client in your project? (Customer Obsession)
When I was doing freelance work for people from my old internship, I was requested to do a project during the busiest period of my finals week. I initially declined it but after a bit of thinking on my time management I decided to take it on and I took most of a few days to finish the project while maintaining my study habits. 

- Tell me about a time when you took calculated risk in your project? (Bias for Action)
    In my undergrad I worked on a functional radar with a transmitter and receiver and we were having a problem with a pcb we used for part of the project but we could not figure out what the issue was. We didn't have much time to debug it as it was the last week so we scrapped the board and had to reassemble a new one within a very small time frame. The board ended up working and we were able to be operational.

- Tell me about a time when you were faced with a problem that had a number of possible solutions. What was the problem and how did you determine the course of action? What was the outcome of that choice?
    A problem I faced recently was for a class where we were in a six person group responsible for a programming project and two weeks into the project we realized that two of our group members were not going to respond to any of our communication so we had to make a decision on how to split work load and what to do about the situation. We got into a call and decided to just split up the work among the remaining people since we could not wait for the professor to do something about the other two students. Working with what we had was what we prioritized.

- When did you take a risk, make a mistake, or fail? How did you respond, and how did you grow from that experience?
    When I first started my last internship I made a few mistakes with one of the earlier versions of a PCB and I was given some loud feedback. I fixed my mistakes but I also realized I was not being meticulous enough so I made it a goal for myself to review my own work and double check everything.

- Describe a time you took the lead on a project.
    Two weeks into a project last year I realized that the group I was in was not going to contact each other about the project until last minute if at all. I started trying to schedule calls to plan project details which sort of worked but not everyone attended or participated with all of them. I also would write down whatever commitments or responsiblities people have agreed to and share them as a list just so every one would be held accountable even me. Towards the end it was mostly just me and one other working on different aspects of the project with one big contribution from one of the other two but I was more focused on just completing the project than anything else. 

- What did you do when you needed to motivate a group of individuals or promote collaboration on a particular project?
    Constant communication is required for motivation, preferably in person since thats how people feel more held accountable. Within those meetings it's important to get some input from everyone so that they feel actually part of the project. 

- How have you leveraged data to develop a strategy?
    We acquired some data on HVAC readings and decided the tech stack it would be processed throught.

- Tell me about a time you were under a lot of pressure. What was going on, and how did you get through it?
    First semester of masters where I was not sure if I was capable, Focused all my time on getting myself ready and self-teaching.

- Tell me a challenge you had where the best way forward was not clear cut. How did you decide what to do?
    Finn board. A project in my internship where I had to convert a two sided board to one layer. The board was already condensed and I was allowed to expand only a small amount. I had unlimited freedom besides that but I had to follow typical circuit building protocols. I decided to split up the board into sections and would reserve space for sections that were particularly important like the power supply. 

- Give me an example of something you tried to accomplish but failed.
    I failed a programming class in UC Davis, I did the class again and passed with some effort. 

- Give me an example of a time when you showed initiative.
    We were at a decision making point where we could not continue with a project idea because of the lack of data on online accessible resources for free so I messaged a researcher from another country and asked him if we could use some of his data within in our project. After some time he was able to send me it. 

    Internship had poorly organized files so with all of my new projects I tried to be as organized as possible, I also took notes for myself on each project that eventually ended up turning into something of a requirement once they noticed my notes. 

    Had issues with a manufacturer so I reached out to them to talk out the issue myself. 

- Give me an example of a time when you motivated others.
    For a project group that was missing two of its members, everyone else was feeling wary about the workload and about the direction of our project in general. I suggested we get into a call and tried to establish a direction at that moment while assuring  others that while realistically we would have to each do more work, we would be find in the end as long as we have a steady pace of progress and I personally took on specific tasks even though I was fairly new to programming. 

- Tell me about a time when you delegated a project effectively.
    In two past groups I have had to get people into calls and define roles withing a project and then have people volunteer for what they prefer or already have knowledge in. 

- Tell me about a time when you coached someone.
    I helped a friend debug his parts of a project a lot. I also tutor my niece in math.

- When have you used your fact-finding skills to solve a problem?
    We were switching to a new manufacturer and we worried about things like the procedure for making an order, how reliable shipping and quality would be, and how responsive they would be with customer relations. I took some time and found some people in our area who had reviewed the same place along with some other reviews and we decided that it would probably be worth the risk .

- Tell me about a time you received critical feedback
When I first started my last internship I made a few mistakes with one of the earlier versions of a PCB and I was given some loud feedback. I fixed my mistakes but I also realized I was not being meticulous enough so I made it a goal for myself to review my own work and double check everything.

- Tell me a time when you work with a tight deadline. What would you change or improve if you gonna do it again? 
HVAC group, besides better member I would have been even more persistent in establshing communication

- Tell me about a time when you helped a teammate. Did he learn something from it? What were the results?
    We had an issue where we were uploading files to github with each iteration instead of pulling and pushing which was causing confusion with version control. I got on a call with my teammate and guided him through the process and towards the end we finally stopped just uploading whole folders. 

    Teammate was having a hard time coming up with progamming design patterns to integrate within his part of project, I went over the purposes of a few of the patterns with him and compared them to what he was working on and we eventually settled on a solution. 

- Tell me about a time when you had to work with no data.
    HVAC project

- Mention about a time when you over-delivered from some one expectations
    Early on in internship I finished projects faster than expected, became my typical time for completion. 

- Tell me about a situation where you had a conflict with someone on your team. What was it about? What did you do? How did they react? What was the outcome?
    Two groups with absent member so we just focused on project and worked with what we had. For first group they were reported to teacher, second not sure. 

- Give an example of when you saw a peer struggling and decided to step in and help. What was the situation and what actions did you take? What was the outcome?
    Peer asking for help in a class discord, I tried to lead them in the right direction while not giving the answer completely, they eventually realized what to do

    Radar project teammate was dealing with child situation so I took on more responsiblities.

- Tell me about a time when you earned your teammate's trust?
    I was able to handle PCB portion of project alone with no prior experience so I became resident PCB expert.

- Tell me about a time when you couldn't meet your deadline?
    Part of the reason why I failed prog class was that I missed the deadline for a project by a day due to being overwhelmed.

- Tell me about a time when your teammate didn't agree with you? What did you do?
    For HVAC project I didnt agree on the tech stack but after some research on tech and thought on time I deferred to her since she has more experience. 

- Tell me about a time when you invented something?
    Established new protocols in internship for how to handle version control

- Tell me about a time when you took important decision without any data?
    First started internship was not thinking about things like thermal dispersion and load imbalance during design

- Time when you were 75% through a project and realized you had the wrong goal.
    Had an emergency session as a group to start over

- Time when you failed to meet your commitment
    Asked for extension for a project

- Time when you didn't meet a deadline
    Felt bad but moved because besides learning from mistakes there is not much use hanging on to past mistakes.

- Time when you needed help from somebody
