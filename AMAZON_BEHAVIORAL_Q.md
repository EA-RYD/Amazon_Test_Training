# Amazon Principles
- Customer Obsession: Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust
- Ownership: They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company. Never say thats not my job.
- Invent and Simplify: Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here"
- Are Right, A Lot: seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs
- Learn and Be Curious: Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
- Hire and Develop the Best: Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization
- Insist on the Highest Standards: Leaders have relentlessly high standards 
- Think Big: Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results
- Bias for Action: Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study.
- Frugality: Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention
- Earn Trust: Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing
- Dive Deep: Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.
- Have Backbone: Disagree and Commit: Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting
- Deliver Results: Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
- Strive to be Earth's Best Employer: Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun.
- Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility: Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.
