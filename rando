Things to read/watch:
Leetcode amazon tagged questions (design)
Did a data structure/algo course on Udemy for like $15


Things to focus on:
- Amazon Favourite LC medium questions
- Knowing time/space efficiency of leetcode problems and algorithms in general
- "production grade" code
- Grilled on data structures and algo, asked about queues, linked lists, stacks, binary trees, graphs, all their functions and time complexities and different ways to implement them. Also asked me about sorting algos and grilled me on time complexity and had to explain how they work. She also asked me how a hashmap works and its different functions, how I'd implement it, etc. She also asked me why I wouldn't use an array to implement a queue (because of a time complexity)
